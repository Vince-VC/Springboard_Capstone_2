Problem Statement:
What are the key indicators of customer churn where at-risk customers can be identified so customer retention & marketing resources can be deployed more effectively to reduce churn by 20% next quarter?


Context:
A universal truth in any industry is that it is far cheaper to keep a current customer than to acquire a new one.
Telecom is no different and Telco has tracked a slew of characteristics (features) of both current customers and customers who churned last quarter.
The task at hand begins with analyzing and identifying relationships between these features and whether or not a customer churned.
The goal is to create a predictive model based on this analysis that can be used to identify customers who share similar features as those who churned before they actually churn so retention & marketing resources can be more effectively deployed to retain that customer.
This should be done with enough precision to reduce churn by 20% next quarter.


Criteria for success:
Success will be measured by the ability to identify key customer features that are highly correlated to a customer churning and using that data to predict and identify additional customers who have yet to churn but share similar features as those who did churn.
The prediction accuracy should be such that pre-churn customers can be identified and retained to reduce customer churn by 20% in the next quarter.


Scope of solution space:
Relationships between a customer who churned and their features in the provided customer data tables will be identified and modeled to be used to predict and identify customers with similar features who have not yet churned.


Constraints within solution space:
If a customer is beyond being able to be retained even though they were identified as at risk before churning.
If there is no clear correlation between churn and individual customer features.

Head of Customer Retention
Head of Customer Service
